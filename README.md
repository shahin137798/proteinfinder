"Protein Sequence Translator and Search Tool"
Overview:
This project provides a command-line tool for translating nucleotide sequences into protein sequences and searching for similar proteins in a given FASTA dataset. It uses a custom codon table for translation and employs sequence similarity matching to identify potential protein matches.

Features:
Parses protein sequences from a FASTA file.
Translates nucleotide sequences into protein sequences based on a codon table.
Searches for matching protein sequences using the difflib SequenceMatcher algorithm.
Suggests the closest matching proteins if an exact match is not found.

Requirements:
Python 3.x
biopython (for Bio.Seq)
A valid FASTA file containing protein sequences

Usage:
Prepare a FASTA file with protein sequences (e.g., uniprotkb_proteome.fasta).
Run the script:
Enter a nucleotide sequence when prompted.
The script will:
Translate the sequence into a protein sequence.
Search for similar proteins in the dataset.
Return the best-matching protein(s) if a match is found.

Notes:
The FASTA file path must be correctly specified in the script.
Similarity threshold can be adjusted in search_protein() for more flexible matching.
